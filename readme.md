# Advent of Code 2016

In this repo, I will solve Advent-Of-Code problems from 2016 in JavaScript. If possible I will try to come up with a visualization of the solution. These visualizations might be much slower than the original solution (because of animation). Not every Problem lends itself to a nice visual representation.

## Day 01: No Time for a Taxicab
- problem: Manhattan Distance 
- insight: reading input in JS
- visuals: breadcrumbs and distance
  
## Day 02: Bathroom Security
- problem: moving through a 2D-Grid
- insight: setting up boundaries for non rectangle shapes
- visuals: tried, but was boring

## Day 03: Squares With Three Sides
- problem: check valid triangles
- insight: constructing the triangles was more fun
- visuals: visual proof of possible triangles

## Day 04: Security Through Obscurity
- problem: checksums on strings and ceasar cypher
- insight: sorting functions!
- visuals: none

## Day 05: How About a Nice Game of Chess?
- problem: MD5 checksums
- insight: bruteforce, JavaScript slow
- visuals: none

## Day 06: Signals and Noise
- problem: most / least frequent letter in String
- insight: functions as arguments 
- visuals: none

## Day 07: Internet Protocol Version 7
- problem: finding repeated letters with overlap
- insight: regex and resetting match-index
- visuals: none

## Day 08: Two-Factor Authentification
- problem: manipulate 2D-Array
- insight: solution *is* the visualization
- visuals: pixel display

## Day 09: Explosives in Cyberspace
- problem: string manipulation
- insight: don't decompress string, keep track of factors instead

## Day 10: Balance Bots
- problem: directed graph and scrambled input
- insight: it's basically bubble sort
- visuals: animated graph showing paths of values

## Day 11: Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators
- problem: graph traversal, shortest path
- insight: aggressive pruning is key, solution might not be generally correct
- visuals: WIP

## Day 12: Leonardos Monorail
- problem: parse asembly code
- insight: simple is good enough
- visuals: none

## Day 13: A Maze of Twisty Little Cubicles
- problem: maze navigation, shortest path
- insight: generative function instead of knowledge of whole maze
- visuals: pathfinder

## Day 14: One-Time Pad
- problem: hashing and salting
- insight: precomputing is key
- visuals: none

## Day 15: Timing is Everything
- problem: predetermine a certain state
- insight: analytic answer might be possible, but brut force works fast enough
- visuals: the last few seconds, before the solution

## Day 16: Dragon Checksum
- problem: recursive generation
- insight: analytic answer might be possible, but brut force works fast enough
- visuals: none

## Day 17: Two Steps Forward
- problem: navigating a changing maze
- insight: BFS and DFS, no circles possible 
- visuals: WIP

## Day 18: Like a Rogue
- problem: enforce simple rules
- insight: again, brute force works
- visuals: in console

## Day 19: An Elephant Named Joseph
- problem: determine final state, not trivial
- insight: brute force not working, but Josephus-Problem (thank you, Numberphile!)
- visuals: none
