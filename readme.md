# Advent of Code 2016

In this repo, I will solve Advent-Of-Code problems from 2016 in JavaScript. If possible I will try to come up with a visualization of the solution. These visualizations might be much slower than the original solution (because of animation). Not every Problem lends itself to a nice visual representation.

## Day 01: No Time for a Taxicab
- problem: Manhattan Distance 
- insight: reading input in JS
- visuals: breadcrumbs and distance
  
## Day 02: Bathroom Security
- problem: moving through a 2D-Grid
- insight: setting up boundaries for non rectangle shapes
- visuals: tried, but was boring

## Day 03: Squares With Three Sides
- problem: check valid triangles
- insight: constructing the triangles was more fun
- visuals: visual proof of possible triangles

- problem: checksums on strings and ceasar cypher
- insight: sorting functions!
- visuals: none

## Day 05: How About a Nice Game of Chess?
- problem: MD5 checksums
- insight: bruteforce, JavaScript slow

## Day 07: Internet Protocol Version 7
- problem: finding repeated letters with overlap
- insight: regex and resetting match-index
- visuals: none

## Day 08: Two-Factor Authentification
- problem: manipulate 2D-Array
- insight: solution *is* the visualization
- visuals: pixel display
