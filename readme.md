# Advent of Code 2016

This page will provide visualized solutions to all AOC-2016-puzzles. I will use JavaScript for problem solving and P5js for visualization. The goal is not to make the most efficient or elegant solutions, in fact, most of the solutions will be much slower because of the animation. Instead, the challenge is to find some form of visualization for every puzzle / solution.
